This is a video chat web app for having convenient singing/voice lessons virtually. The repository contains two web pages. The login.html file is the login page where the user enters their credentials, and the videoChat.html file contains the main video chat page, where two participants can join the same channel and conduct a video chat session. The page has some convenient features, like a virtual piano and helpful musical references.
